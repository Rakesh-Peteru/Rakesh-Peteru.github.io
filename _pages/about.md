Hi! I'm **Sai Rakesh Peteru**, an Electrical Engineering undergraduate passionate about control systems, biologically inspired robotics, and computer vision.

My research explores how we can use biological strategies—like how honeybees intercept moving targets—to design intelligent motion planning and adaptive control in robotics. I'm especially interested in:
- PID and model-based control of autonomous systems
- Learning-based motion strategies for aerial robots
- Region-based classification dynamics inspired by brain networks

Currently, I'm working on trajectory prediction models from bee interception data, and designing hybrid control architectures for transformable flying-walking robots.
